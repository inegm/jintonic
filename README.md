# jintonic #

A package of tools for composition in just intonation with Python.

David B. Doty's technical definition of just intonation :

  *Just Intonation is any system of tuning in which all of the intervals can
  be represented by whole-number frequency ratios, with a strongly implied
  preference for the simplest ratios compatible with a given musical purpose.*

You can find a more lyrical definition in the first chapter of his primer,
which is available online [here](http://www.dbdoty.com/Words/Primer_2.1.html)

I strongly recommend his book : "The Just Intonation Primer". It is listed in
the references below.
